# ParlIR

**ParlIR** is an test collection for evaluating category-aware retrieval over the record of the European Parliament. It is designed for retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) settings where documents that are equally on topic differ in what they can be used to establish. For example, a speech expresses a position of an individual or party, while an adopted text records a decision of Parliament.

| File | Format | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `corpus.jsonl` | JSON Lines, one passage per line | 297,279 passages |
| `topics.json` | JSON array | 142 topics with their target distributions |

### Corpus file

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `passage_id` | Unique passage identifier |
| `doc_id` | Identifier of the source document |
| `doc_type` | One of the 21 document types listed under [Corpus](#corpus) |
| `categories` | Evidence categories of the passage |
| `date` | Sitting or publication date, where available |
| `url` | URL of the source document |
| `text` | Passage text |

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `passage_id` | Unique passage identifier |
| `doc_id` | Identifier of the source document |
| `doc_type` | One of the 21 document types listed under [Corpus](#corpus) |
| `categories` | Evidence categories of the passage |
| `date` | Sitting or publication date, where available |
| `url` | URL of the source document |
| `text` | Passage text |

### Topics file

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `topic_id` | Unique topic identifier |
| `title` | Short form of the question |
| `description` | Fuller statement of the information need |
| `narrative` | Which document types can and cannot answer the topic |
| `weights` | Target distribution over the five evidence categories (sums to 1) |

Identifiers run from 1 to 143 with one gap, topic 35 having been withdrawn
during annotation.

### Judgements file

TREC qrels format, one judgement per line:

```
topic_id 0 passage_id label
```

`label` is 1 for relevant and 0 for not relevant. The second column is the
unused iteration field retained for compatibility with standard evaluation
tools. Only judged pairs appear; a passage absent from the file is unjudged
rather than known to be irrelevant.

## Evidence categories

| Category | What it can be used to establish |
|---|---|
| Decision | What Parliament as a body decided or adopted, and what the adopted text says |
| Position | What a political actor (Member, political group, party, or delegation) stands for, argued, or asked |
| Proceedings | Where a file or meeting stands, what happened when, and what is under debate |
| Actors | Who Members and political groups are, and what offices they hold |
| Institution | How the EU and Parliament are constituted and how their rules and procedures work in general |

## Corpus

The corpus covers the ninth parliamentary term and the first two years of the tenth. All texts are in English.

| Minutes | 10,942 | 10,942 | decision, proceedings |
| Text adopted | 2,969 | 12,772 | decision |
| Report | 1,800 | 74,359 | proceedings |
| Committee opinion | 1,400 | 22,575 | proceedings |
| Motion for resolution | 2,775 | 18,067 | position |

| Rule | 251 | 259 | institution |
| Annex | 8 | 24 | institution |
| *Structured data rendered as text* | | | |
| Procedure file | 3,177 | 15,955 | proceedings |
| MEP profile: authored documents | 1,258 | 14,770 | actors, proceedings |
| MEP profile: biography | 1,277 | 1,277 | actors |
| MEP profile: committee memberships | 1,269 | 1,293 | actors |
| MEP profile: delegation memberships | 1,259 | 1,264 | actors |
| MEP profile: dossier roles | 771 | 1,062 | actors, proceedings |
| MEP profile: other roles | 211 | 211 | actors |
| MEP profile: political affiliations | 1,277 | 1,277 | actors |
| **Total** | **62,925** | **297,279** | |

Documents are split into passages following their natural structure where possible. For example, transcripts are split into one passage per speech, and written questions are kept together with their answers. Longer documents are split into passages of fixed length. Procedure files and MEP profiles are database records, which are rendered as text from fixed templates without the use of a language model.

## Topics

The 142 topics are based on questions asked by users of the ParliView platform. Each topic has a title, a description, a narrative, and a target distribution over the five evidence categories, giving the proportion of each kind of evidence a good answer would rely on.

The target distributions were assigned independently by three expert annotators familiar with the European Parliament and with this collection, each distributing ten points across the categories for every topic. The released distribution is their mean. Because each annotation is a distribution rather than a label, agreement is measured with Krippendorff's α under a difference function: over the 134 topics all three annotators covered, α = 0.75 taking total variation distance as the difference function, and 0.89 taking squared Euclidean distance. The dominant category is unanimous on 107 of those 134 topics.

## Relevance judgements

The collection includes binary relevance judgements for 35,500 topic–passage pairs, pooled to depth 250 per topic.

> **TODO:** pooling method — which retrieval systems contributed candidates, and at what depth.

Labels were generated with an LLM (OpenAI `gpt-6-luna`) prompted with the topic title, description and narrative together with the passage text. 5,399 pairs (15.2%) are judged relevant, a median of 18 per topic; 12 topics have no relevant passage in their pool and contribute to the category-composition measures but not to relevance-based ones.

The labels were validated against an expert annotator who independently judged the top 20 passages of a stratified sample of topics without sight of the model's labels. Over 160 such judgements, agreement is 85.0% with Cohen's κ = 0.67. Agreement varies by evidence category, and is lowest on topics whose answers rest on what Parliament decided, where a passage discussing a measure is readily mistaken for one that settles it.

## Original data sources

All distributed texts and records are taken from European Parliament sources:
